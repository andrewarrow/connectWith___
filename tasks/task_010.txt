# Task ID: 10
# Title: Develop Debug and Diagnostics View
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a technical interface showing detailed insights into Bluetooth connectivity, sync status, and data exchange processes.
# Details:
Implement a hidden developer menu that provides:
1. Real-time logs of Bluetooth discovery and connection attempts
2. Data transfer statistics (bytes sent/received, success rates)
3. Sync conflict resolution details
4. Device connection history and quality metrics
5. Battery usage statistics related to Bluetooth operations
6. Options to force sync or clear sync history
7. Detailed error logs and diagnostic information
8. Export functionality for logs

Make this view accessible through a hidden gesture or developer setting.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all diagnostic information is accurate. Test log export functionality. Ensure the interface provides useful troubleshooting information. Test that the view is properly hidden from regular users but accessible when needed.
