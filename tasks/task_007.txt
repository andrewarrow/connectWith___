# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Bluetooth Connection and Data Exchange
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the system for establishing Bluetooth connections between devices and exchanging calendar data securely.
# Details:
Create a connection manager and data exchange protocol that:
1. Establishes secure connections between discovered devices
2. Implements a JSON-based protocol for data transfer
3. Handles serialization/deserialization of Core Data models
4. Implements incremental syncing to minimize data transfer
5. Includes error handling and retry logic
6. Logs connection and transfer statistics to SyncLog
7. Implements Bluetooth encryption plus application-layer verification
8. Handles connection timeouts and interruptions gracefully

Optimize for reliability and minimal data transfer to preserve battery life.

# Test Strategy:
Test data exchange between multiple devices. Verify correct serialization and deserialization. Test connection reliability under various conditions (distance, interference). Measure data transfer efficiency and optimize.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Bluetooth Connection Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a BluetoothConnectionManager class that handles device discovery, connection establishment, and connection state management with proper security measures.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a BluetoothConnectionManager class that implements CoreBluetooth protocols (CBCentralManagerDelegate, CBPeripheralDelegate)
2. Implement device discovery functionality with filtering for compatible devices
3. Create methods for establishing secure connections with discovered devices
4. Implement connection state management (connecting, connected, disconnected, failed)
5. Add Bluetooth encryption and application-layer verification
6. Implement connection timeout handling with configurable timeouts
7. Add graceful disconnection and reconnection logic
8. Create a delegate protocol to notify other components about connection events

Testing approach:
- Unit test the state management logic with mocked Bluetooth objects
- Integration test with actual devices to verify connection establishment
- Test timeout scenarios by simulating connection delays
- Verify security implementation with connection attempts between authorized and unauthorized devices

## 2. Develop Data Exchange Protocol and Serialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a JSON-based protocol for data exchange and implement serialization/deserialization between Core Data models and the transfer format.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a JSON schema for calendar data exchange that supports incremental updates
2. Create a DataExchangeProtocol class that defines message types (e.g., sync request, data chunk, acknowledgment)
3. Implement serialization from Core Data models to JSON format
4. Implement deserialization from JSON to Core Data models
5. Add data validation to ensure integrity during transfer
6. Create a chunking mechanism to handle large data sets
7. Implement protocol versioning to support future changes
8. Add data compression to minimize transfer size

Testing approach:
- Unit test serialization/deserialization with various calendar data models
- Test edge cases like empty data sets and maximum-sized calendar entries
- Verify data integrity is maintained through the serialization process
- Benchmark compression ratios and processing overhead
- Test protocol versioning with simulated version mismatches

## 3. Implement Sync Engine with Error Handling and Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create a SyncEngine that orchestrates incremental data synchronization with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and detailed logging.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a SyncEngine class that coordinates the sync process using the connection manager and data exchange protocol
2. Implement incremental sync logic that identifies and transfers only changed data
3. Add conflict resolution strategies for simultaneous changes
4. Implement comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios
5. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed transfers
6. Create a SyncLog system to record detailed statistics (connection duration, data transferred, success/failure)
7. Implement battery-aware optimizations (batch transfers, connection management)
8. Add a sync queue to manage multiple pending sync operations

Testing approach:
- Unit test the incremental sync logic with various change scenarios
- Test error recovery by simulating connection drops and data corruption
- Verify retry logic works correctly with different error conditions
- Test conflict resolution with simultaneous changes on multiple devices
- Analyze logs to ensure all required metrics are captured
- Perform battery usage testing to verify optimizations are effective
