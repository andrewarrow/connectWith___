Task 9.2 "Build History List UI with Grouping and Filtering" has been completed.

The following components were implemented:

1. Created HistoryListView.swift with the following features:
   - Section-based list with month headers (expandable/collapsible)
   - Detailed history item cells showing edit information
   - Filter controls for family members (device selection)
   - Date range filtering with preset options and custom date range support
   - Empty state handling when no history is available
   - Detail view for each history item showing the exact changes made

2. Updated MainMenuView to include access to the new History feature through:
   - Added a new menu item "Edit History" with an appropriate icon
   - Connected menu item to display the HistoryListView when tapped

The implementation connects to the HistoryManager from task 9.1 and properly displays all edit history data with comprehensive filtering capabilities as required.
