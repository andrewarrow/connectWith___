# Task ID: 9.1
# Title: Implement Core Data Integration for Edit History
# Status: complete
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Created the data layer for retrieving and managing edit history records from Core Data, including fetching, sorting, and grouping functionality.

## Completed Work:
1. Created a new `HistoryManager` class in `EditHistoryManager.swift` to handle Core Data operations for EditHistory entities
2. Implemented methods to fetch all history records sorted by date
3. Added functionality to group history records by month
4. Created data structures to represent history items for the UI layer
5. Implemented methods to retrieve edit details (what changed, who made the change)
6. Added support for filtering history by family member or date range
7. Created unit tests for the HistoryManager class in `HistoryManagerTests.swift`

The `HistoryManager` class provides all the necessary functionality for the History List UI to display the edit history in a user-friendly format. It handles the conversion of Core Data entities to UI-friendly structures and manages the grouping and filtering operations required by the UI.

## Testing Notes:
- The unit tests verify all core functionality of the `HistoryManager` class
- Tests include fetching, filtering, grouping, and data transformation operations
- Tests use an in-memory Core Data store for isolated testing
