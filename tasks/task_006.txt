# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Family Device Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the UI for discovering, naming, and managing family members' devices for synchronization.
# Details:
Implement a device management interface that:
1. Displays discovered devices running 12x
2. Allows naming devices with family member names
3. Shows connection status and last sync time
4. Provides options to forget/remove devices
5. Indicates the local device
6. Stores device associations in the FamilyDevice model
7. Handles the case when new devices are discovered

Design the interface to be user-friendly and focus on family member names rather than technical identifiers.

# Test Strategy:
Test device discovery, naming, and management with multiple devices. Verify persistence of device names across app restarts. Test edge cases like duplicate names and removing devices.
