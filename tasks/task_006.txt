# Task ID: 6
# Title: Create Family Device Management Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build the UI for discovering, naming, and managing family members' devices for synchronization.
# Details:
Implement a device management interface that:
1. Displays discovered devices running 12x
2. Allows naming devices with family member names
3. Shows connection status and last sync time
4. Provides options to forget/remove devices
5. Indicates the local device
6. Stores device associations in the FamilyDevice model
7. Handles the case when new devices are discovered

Design the interface to be user-friendly and focus on family member names rather than technical identifiers.

# Test Strategy:
Test device discovery, naming, and management with multiple devices. Verify persistence of device names across app restarts. Test edge cases like duplicate names and removing devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Device Discovery and Display UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the UI components to discover and display devices running 12x in the family network
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a DeviceDiscoveryManager class that uses Bonjour/Network Service Discovery to find devices running the 12x app
2. Implement a DeviceListViewController with a UITableView to display discovered devices
3. Design custom UITableViewCell for device entries with appropriate layout for device information
4. Add a refresh control to allow manual scanning for devices
5. Implement local device detection and highlight it in the UI
6. Add loading indicators during device discovery process
7. Create placeholder UI elements for connection status and sync time (to be implemented in subtask 2)

Testing approach:
- Test device discovery on local network with multiple devices
- Verify UI updates when devices appear/disappear
- Test refresh functionality
- Confirm local device is properly identified

## 2. Implement Device Naming and Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Add functionality to name devices with family member names and display connection status information
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a DeviceDetailViewController that appears when selecting a device
2. Add text field for entering/editing family member names for devices
3. Implement connection status indicators showing online/offline state
4. Add last sync time display with appropriate formatting
5. Create a ConnectionManager class to monitor device connectivity
6. Implement status update mechanism to refresh connection status periodically
7. Design UI indicators for connection status (green for connected, red for disconnected)
8. Add validation for family member names (prevent duplicates, empty names)

Testing approach:
- Test name assignment and persistence
- Verify status indicators update correctly when devices connect/disconnect
- Test edge cases like long names, special characters
- Verify sync time displays correctly in different formats

## 3. Implement Core Data Integration and Device Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the Core Data model for device storage and implement device management features
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create FamilyDevice Core Data model with properties for device identifier, name, last sync time, and connection status
2. Implement CoreDataManager to handle CRUD operations for FamilyDevice entities
3. Add functionality to forget/remove devices with confirmation dialog
4. Create a DeviceSyncManager to track and update last sync times
5. Implement automatic device association when new devices are discovered
6. Add migration logic for existing devices when app updates
7. Create a notification system for when device status changes
8. Implement data persistence between app launches

Testing approach:
- Test adding, removing, and updating devices in Core Data
- Verify device associations persist after app restart
- Test device removal flow and confirm proper cleanup
- Verify new device discovery and automatic association
- Test edge cases like data migration and recovery from corruption
