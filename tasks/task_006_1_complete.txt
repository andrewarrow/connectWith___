## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the Device Discovery and Display UI for the Family Device Management Interface. This implementation provides a user-friendly interface for discovering, viewing, and interacting with family members' devices.

## Implemented Features
1. **BluetoothDiscoveryManager**: Integrated with existing Bluetooth discovery functionality to find devices running the app
2. **NearbyDevicesView**: Created a SwiftUI view to display discovered devices with appropriate layout and styling
3. **DeviceRow**: Designed a custom row component for device entries with visual indicators for connection status
4. **Refresh Control**: Implemented pull-to-refresh for manual device scanning
5. **Local Device Detection**: Added functionality to highlight the user's own device in the UI
6. **Loading Indicators**: Created a scanning overlay with progress animation during device discovery
7. **Connection Status UI**: Implemented visual indicators for device connection status
8. **Device Renaming**: Added ability to rename devices through a sheet interface

## Implementation Details
- Used CoreData to persist device information between app sessions
- Implemented proper error handling for Bluetooth operations
- Created a responsive UI that adapts to different device states
- Utilized SwiftUI best practices with extracted components for maintainability
- Added appropriate animations for loading states and transitions
- Integrated with the main app navigation flow

## Testing Performed
- Tested device discovery on local network
- Verified UI updates when devices appear/disappear
- Tested refresh functionality
- Confirmed local device is properly identified
- Tested with multiple device representations

## Next Steps
Proceed to Task 6.2: Implement Device Naming and Status Indicators, which will build upon this foundation to add more sophisticated naming and connection status features.
