# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build Event Creation and Editing Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the interface for creating and editing event details on the monthly cards, including title, location, and date fields.
# Details:
Create a modal edit interface that appears when a month card is tapped, containing:
1. Title input field with appropriate validation
2. Location input field
3. Date picker limited to the selected month
4. Preview of how the card will look with changes
5. Confirmation and cancel buttons
6. Logic to save changes to Core Data
7. Code to update the EditHistory when changes are made
8. Device identifier tracking for edit attribution

Ensure the interface is intuitive and follows iOS design guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation, data saving, and UI state updates. Verify edit history is properly recorded with all required fields. Test edge cases like empty fields and cancellation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Modal Presentation and Form UI [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the modal interface for event creation and editing, including all form elements and basic layout.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new SwiftUI view called `EventEditView` that will serve as the modal
2. Implement the form layout with the following elements:
   - Title input field with appropriate styling
   - Location input field
   - Date picker component configured to show only dates in the selected month
   - Preview section (placeholder for now)
   - Confirmation and Cancel buttons at the bottom
3. Set up the modal presentation logic to appear when a month card is tapped
4. Implement basic state management for form fields
5. Style the interface according to iOS design guidelines
6. Add accessibility labels and hints for all form elements

Testing approach:
- Verify modal appears and dismisses correctly
- Check that all UI elements render properly
- Test keyboard appearance and dismissal
- Verify basic form navigation works
- Test on different device sizes to ensure responsive layout

## 2. Implement Form Validation and Preview Functionality [completed]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add validation logic to the form fields and create the live preview functionality to show how the card will look with changes.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Add validation logic for the title field:
   - Ensure it's not empty
   - Set minimum length of 3 characters
   - Set maximum length of 50 characters
   - Ensure title starts with a letter
   - Show appropriate error messages
2. Implement validation for the location field:
   - Ensure it's not empty
   - Set minimum length of 3 characters
   - Set maximum length of 100 characters
   - Show appropriate error messages
3. Add validation for the date picker to ensure it stays within the selected month
4. Enhanced the preview component that updates in real-time:
   - Designed a miniature version of the month card that reflects the actual card design
   - Added real-time validation status indicators
   - Implemented animations to highlight validation state
   - Added ability to toggle preview visibility
5. Implemented visual feedback for validation errors:
   - Error messages under form fields
   - Visual indicators in the preview 
   - Disabled submit button when form is invalid
6. Added form submission prevention if validation fails

Testing approach:
- Created sample events with invalid data in the preview provider
- Added dedicated preview for the card component
- Test cases for various validation states
- Test edge cases like very long text inputs and boundary conditions
- Verified the preview accurately represents how the final card will look

## 3. Implement Data Persistence and Edit History Tracking [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Add Core Data integration to save event changes and implement the edit history tracking functionality.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create Core Data integration:
   - Connect form submission to Core Data save operations
   - Implement logic to update existing events or create new ones
   - Handle potential save errors gracefully
2. Implement edit history tracking:
   - Create or update the EditHistory model in Core Data
   - Record timestamp of edits
   - Store the device identifier for edit attribution
   - Track what fields were changed
3. Add confirmation dialog before saving changes
4. Implement success/failure feedback after save attempts
5. Add logic to populate the form with existing data when editing
6. Ensure proper cleanup of Core Data context if the user cancels
7. Optimize for performance with potential batch updates

Testing approach:
- Verify data is correctly saved to Core Data
- Test editing existing events loads the correct data
- Confirm edit history is properly recorded
- Test cancellation doesn't affect stored data
- Verify device attribution is correctly recorded
- Test error handling with simulated Core Data failures
