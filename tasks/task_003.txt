# Title: Build Event Creation and Editing Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the interface for creating and editing event details on the monthly cards, including title, location, and date fields.
# Details:
Create a modal edit interface that appears when a month card is tapped, containing:
1. Title input field with appropriate validation
2. Location input field
3. Date picker limited to the selected month
4. Preview of how the card will look with changes
5. Confirmation and cancel buttons
6. Logic to save changes to Core Data
7. Code to update the EditHistory when changes are made
8. Device identifier tracking for edit attribution

Ensure the interface is intuitive and follows iOS design guidelines.

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation, data saving, and UI state updates. Verify edit history is properly recorded with all required fields. Test edge cases like empty fields and cancellation.
