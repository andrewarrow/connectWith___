Task 7.2: Develop Data Exchange Protocol and Serialization

This task has been completed successfully by implementing the DataExchangeProtocol class which provides:

1. A JSON-based protocol for data exchange between devices
2. Incremental update support with timestamp-based sync mechanism
3. Full serialization/deserialization between Core Data models and JSON
4. Multiple message types to handle different sync operations:
   - SyncRequest/Response for initiating sync operations
   - DataChunk/ChunkAck for transferring data in manageable chunks
   - SyncComplete for finalizing sync sessions
   - Error messages for handling problems

5. Strong data validation with SHA-256 checksums to ensure data integrity
6. Automatic chunking mechanism to handle large data transfers within BLE constraints
7. Protocol versioning (1.0) with version compatibility checking
8. Data compression infrastructure for minimizing transfer size
9. Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to map between Core Data entities and transferable formats

The implementation fully supports the sync operations needed for:
- Events (calendar entries)
- Edit history records
- Family device information

This implementation integrates with the existing ConnectionManager and BluetoothDiscoveryManager to complete the data exchange layer of the 12x app.
