# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Conflict Resolution and Sync Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the algorithms for merging conflicting edits from different devices while preserving all family members' input.
# Details:
Create a synchronization engine with:
1. Three-way merge algorithm for handling concurrent edits
2. Timestamp-based conflict detection
3. Edit preservation policy that never deletes information during conflicts
4. Chronological merging of edit histories
5. Prioritization rules for conflicting fields
6. Automatic resolution for most conflicts
7. Logging of all sync activities and conflict resolutions
8. Notification system for completed syncs

Ensure the system is robust against partial syncs and interrupted connections.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test cases for various conflict scenarios. Verify that no data is lost during conflict resolution. Test with simulated network interruptions and partial syncs. Verify edit history accurately reflects all changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Sync Engine with Timestamp-based Conflict Detection [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the foundation of the sync engine with timestamp-based conflict detection and the three-way merge algorithm for handling concurrent edits.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a SyncEngine class that manages the synchronization process between devices
2. Implement timestamp tracking for all data objects to detect when changes occurred
3. Develop conflict detection logic that identifies when the same data was modified on multiple devices
4. Build the three-way merge algorithm that compares:
   - The common ancestor version (base)
   - Local version (modified by current device)
   - Remote version (modified by another device)
5. Implement basic synchronization flow:
   - Fetch remote changes
   - Detect conflicts using timestamps
   - Apply non-conflicting changes automatically
   - Flag conflicting changes for resolution
6. Add error handling for network interruptions and partial syncs
7. Create unit tests for:
   - Timestamp comparison logic
   - Conflict detection with various scenarios
   - Three-way merge with non-conflicting changes
   - Recovery from interrupted syncs

## 2. Develop Conflict Resolution Policies and Prioritization Rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement the conflict resolution strategies that preserve all family members' edits and apply prioritization rules for conflicting fields.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Extend the SyncEngine with ConflictResolver component
2. Implement the edit preservation policy ensuring no information is deleted during conflicts:
   - For text fields: concatenate conflicting values with attribution
   - For list items: merge all items from both versions
   - For structured data: preserve all fields from both versions
3. Create field-specific resolution strategies based on data types:
   - Dates: use latest timestamp unless explicitly modified
   - Numbers: provide options for sum, average, or latest value
   - Boolean values: implement OR/AND logic based on context
4. Develop prioritization rules for specific fields:
   - Define field importance hierarchy
   - Create user preference settings for resolution strategies
   - Implement override capabilities for designated family admins
5. Build automatic resolution logic for common conflict patterns
6. Add manual resolution UI hooks for complex conflicts
7. Test with:
   - Simulated concurrent edits across multiple fields
   - Edge cases with partially conflicting data
   - Verification that no user data is lost during merges

## 3. Implement Chronological History Merging and Sync Activity Logging [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create the system for merging edit histories chronologically and develop comprehensive logging and notification for sync activities.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a data structure for storing edit history with:
   - Timestamps for each change
   - User identification
   - Device information
   - Before/after values
2. Implement chronological merging of edit histories:
   - Sort all edits by timestamp across devices
   - Handle edits with identical timestamps
   - Maintain causal relationships between dependent edits
3. Create a SyncLogger component that records:
   - All sync attempts (successful and failed)
   - Conflicts detected and how they were resolved
   - Performance metrics and timing information
   - Error conditions and recovery actions
4. Implement the notification system for completed syncs:
   - Push notifications for mobile devices
   - In-app notifications for active users
   - Email summaries for major conflicts or sync issues
   - Custom notification preferences per user
5. Add a sync dashboard for viewing:
   - Recent sync activity
   - Pending conflicts requiring attention
   - Sync health metrics
6. Test with:
   - Complex multi-device sync scenarios
   - Verification of history correctness after merges
   - Notification delivery across platforms
   - Log analysis for troubleshooting capabilities
