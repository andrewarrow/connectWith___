# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement History Log and Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the interface for viewing the chronological edit history of events, showing how plans evolved over time.
# Details:
Build a history visualization interface that:
1. Displays a chronological list of edits grouped by month
2. Shows who made each change (family member name)
3. Highlights what changed in each edit (title, location, date)
4. Provides filtering options by family member or time period
5. Uses clear visual design to show the evolution of events
6. Handles the display of conflict resolutions
7. Integrates with the EditHistory model

Focus on making the history easy to understand for non-technical users.

# Test Strategy:
Test history display with various edit scenarios. Verify filtering works correctly. Test with large history datasets for performance. Ensure the UI clearly communicates what changed in each edit.
