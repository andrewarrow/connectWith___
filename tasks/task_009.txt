# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement History Log and Visualization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the interface for viewing the chronological edit history of events, showing how plans evolved over time.
# Details:
Build a history visualization interface that:
1. Displays a chronological list of edits grouped by month
2. Shows who made each change (family member name)
3. Highlights what changed in each edit (title, location, date)
4. Provides filtering options by family member or time period
5. Uses clear visual design to show the evolution of events
6. Handles the display of conflict resolutions
7. Integrates with the EditHistory model

Focus on making the history easy to understand for non-technical users.

# Test Strategy:
Test history display with various edit scenarios. Verify filtering works correctly. Test with large history datasets for performance. Ensure the UI clearly communicates what changed in each edit.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Data Integration for Edit History [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the data layer for retrieving and managing edit history records from Core Data, including fetching, sorting, and grouping functionality.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a HistoryManager class to handle Core Data operations for EditHistory entities
2. Implement methods to fetch all history records sorted by date
3. Add functionality to group history records by month
4. Create data structures to represent history items for the UI layer
5. Implement methods to retrieve edit details (what changed, who made the change)
6. Add support for filtering history by family member or date range
7. Create unit tests for the HistoryManager class

Testing approach:
- Write unit tests for each Core Data fetch and filter operation
- Create sample EditHistory records to verify grouping logic
- Test edge cases like empty history or multiple edits on the same day

## 2. Build History List UI with Grouping and Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Develop the user interface components for displaying the chronological list of edits with month-based grouping and implement filtering controls.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a HistoryListView as the main container for the history visualization
2. Implement a section-based list with month headers using List or UITableView
3. Design and implement history item cells showing edit date, family member name, and a summary of changes
4. Add a filter control panel with options for filtering by family member
5. Implement a date range picker for time period filtering
6. Connect the UI to the HistoryManager from subtask 1
7. Ensure the list updates when filters are applied
8. Add empty state handling when no history items match filters

Testing approach:
- Create UI tests to verify list rendering with sample data
- Test filter interactions to ensure proper filtering
- Verify month grouping headers display correctly
- Test responsiveness on different device sizes

## 3. Implement Change Highlighting and Detail View [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create the detailed view of individual edit history items with visual highlighting of changes and implement conflict resolution display.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a HistoryDetailView to show complete information about an edit
2. Create visual components to highlight what changed in each edit (title, location, date)
3. Implement before/after comparison for changed fields
4. Add special visual treatment for conflict resolutions
5. Design and implement animations or transitions to show evolution between states
6. Create a navigation flow from the history list to the detail view
7. Ensure the detail view is accessible and easy to understand
8. Add options to navigate between consecutive edits

Testing approach:
- Test the detail view with various types of edits (title changes, date changes, etc.)
- Verify conflict resolution display works correctly
- Test accessibility features
- Ensure navigation between list and detail views works smoothly
