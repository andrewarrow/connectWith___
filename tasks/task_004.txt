# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Onboarding Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the app's initial onboarding experience including welcome screens, Bluetooth permission requests, and initial setup.
# Details:
Design and implement an onboarding flow with:
1. Welcome screens explaining the 12x concept and value proposition
2. Permission request for Bluetooth access with clear explanation
3. Device identification setup (for local device)
4. Initial calendar view setup with empty month cards
5. First-time user guidance overlays
6. Skip options for returning users

Store onboarding completion status to avoid showing it to returning users.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete onboarding flow on first launch. Verify permission dialogs appear correctly. Test skipping onboarding on subsequent launches. Verify the app state is properly initialized after onboarding.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Welcome and Introduction Screens [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the initial welcome screens that introduce the app concept, value proposition, and prepare users for the onboarding process
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a welcome screen component with app logo, title, and tagline
2. Design and implement 2-3 introduction slides explaining the 12x concept and value proposition
3. Add navigation controls (next/back buttons, progress indicators)
4. Implement skip option for returning users
5. Create a persistent storage utility to save onboarding completion status
6. Add logic to check if user has completed onboarding before and bypass if needed
7. Testing approach: Verify all screens display correctly, navigation works as expected, and returning users can skip the flow

## 2. Implement Permission Requests and Device Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Handle Bluetooth permission requests with clear explanations and implement the device identification setup process
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a permission request screen explaining why Bluetooth access is needed
2. Implement the Bluetooth permission request logic with proper OS-specific handling
3. Add fallback screens for permission denial with instructions to enable manually
4. Create device identification setup screen for local device
5. Implement device naming and identification storage functionality
6. Add validation for device setup inputs
7. Connect permission and device setup flows to the welcome screens from subtask 1
8. Testing approach: Test permission requests on different OS versions, verify proper handling of permission grants/denials, and ensure device identification data is properly saved

## 3. Implement Calendar View Setup and First-time User Guidance [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create the initial calendar view with empty month cards and implement first-time user guidance overlays
