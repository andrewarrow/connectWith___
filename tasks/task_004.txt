# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Onboarding Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the app's initial onboarding experience including welcome screens, Bluetooth permission requests, and initial setup.
# Details:
Design and implement an onboarding flow with:
1. Welcome screens explaining the 12x concept and value proposition
2. Permission request for Bluetooth access with clear explanation
3. Device identification setup (for local device)
4. Initial calendar view setup with empty month cards
5. First-time user guidance overlays
6. Skip options for returning users

Store onboarding completion status to avoid showing it to returning users.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete onboarding flow on first launch. Verify permission dialogs appear correctly. Test skipping onboarding on subsequent launches. Verify the app state is properly initialized after onboarding.
