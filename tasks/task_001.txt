# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Core Data Models and Database
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the local SQLite database with Core Data models for Event, EditHistory, FamilyDevice, and SyncLog entities as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a Core Data stack with the following models:
1. Event: UUID, month (1-12), title, location, day (1-31), createdAt, lastModifiedAt, lastModifiedBy, color
2. EditHistory: UUID, eventId, deviceId, deviceName, previousTitle, newTitle, previousLocation, newLocation, previousDay, newDay, timestamp
3. FamilyDevice: UUID, bluetoothIdentifier, customName, lastSyncTimestamp, isLocalDevice
4. SyncLog: UUID, timestamp, deviceId, deviceName, eventsReceived, eventsSent, conflicts, resolutionMethod, details

Implement CRUD operations for all entities and ensure data encryption using iOS data protection.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each model and CRUD operation. Verify data persistence across app restarts. Test data encryption and ensure proper relationships between entities.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Data Model and Stack [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data model schema with all required entities and set up the Core Data stack with proper encryption
### Details:
1. ✅ Create a new Core Data model file (.xcdatamodeld)
2. ✅ Define the Event entity with attributes: UUID, month (Int16), title (String), location (String), day (Int16), createdAt (Date), lastModifiedAt (Date), lastModifiedBy (String), color (String)
3. ✅ Define the EditHistory entity with attributes: UUID, eventId (String), deviceId (String), deviceName (String), previousTitle (String), newTitle (String), previousLocation (String), newLocation (String), previousDay (Int16), newDay (Int16), timestamp (Date)
4. ✅ Define the FamilyDevice entity with attributes: UUID, bluetoothIdentifier (String), customName (String), lastSyncTimestamp (Date), isLocalDevice (Boolean)
5. ✅ Define the SyncLog entity with attributes: UUID, timestamp (Date), deviceId (String), deviceName (String), eventsReceived (Int32), eventsSent (Int32), conflicts (Int32), resolutionMethod (String), details (String)
6. ✅ Set up relationships between entities (e.g., Event to EditHistory)
7. ✅ Create a CoreDataManager class with:
   - Persistent container setup
   - Context management (main and background)
   - Data protection configuration using NSFileProtectionComplete
8. ✅ Implement database initialization and migration handling
9. ✅ Test the Core Data stack initialization and verify data protection is enabled

## 2. Implement CRUD Operations for All Entities [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive data access layer with CRUD operations for all entities
### Details:
1. Create a DataRepository protocol defining generic CRUD operations
2. Implement EventRepository:
   - Create/add new events
   - Retrieve events (by UUID, month, or all)
   - Update event properties
   - Delete events
   - Query events by various parameters
3. Implement EditHistoryRepository:
   - Record edit history entries
   - Retrieve history for specific events
   - Query history by device or timeframe
4. Implement FamilyDeviceRepository:
   - Register devices
   - Update device information
   - Get local device
   - List all family devices
5. Implement SyncLogRepository:
   - Create sync log entries
   - Retrieve logs by timeframe or device
6. Add transaction support for operations that modify multiple entities
7. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
8. Create unit tests for each repository:
   - Test all CRUD operations
   - Verify constraints and validation
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

## 3. Create Data Access Facade and Encryption Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Implement a unified data access facade and ensure proper data encryption
### Details:
1. Create a DataManager facade class that:
   - Provides a simplified interface to all repositories
   - Handles complex operations involving multiple entities
   - Manages data consistency across entities
2. Implement data encryption verification:
   - Add methods to verify encryption status
   - Create a utility to check if data protection is active
   - Add logging for encryption-related events
3. Implement data migration utilities:
   - Version migration support
   - Data integrity checks
4. Add performance optimizations:
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add batch operations for better performance
5. Create integration tests:
   - Test the complete data flow through the facade
   - Verify data consistency across repositories
   - Test encryption by examining the database file
   - Measure and optimize performance
6. Document the API:
   - Create usage examples
   - Document thread safety considerations
   - Add inline documentation for all public methods
