# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the local SQLite database with Core Data models for Event, EditHistory, FamilyDevice, and SyncLog entities as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Create a Core Data stack with the following models:
1. Event: UUID, month (1-12), title, location, day (1-31), createdAt, lastModifiedAt, lastModifiedBy, color
2. EditHistory: UUID, eventId, deviceId, deviceName, previousTitle, newTitle, previousLocation, newLocation, previousDay, newDay, timestamp
3. FamilyDevice: UUID, bluetoothIdentifier, customName, lastSyncTimestamp, isLocalDevice
4. SyncLog: UUID, timestamp, deviceId, deviceName, eventsReceived, eventsSent, conflicts, resolutionMethod, details

Implement CRUD operations for all entities and ensure data encryption using iOS data protection.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each model and CRUD operation. Verify data persistence across app restarts. Test data encryption and ensure proper relationships between entities.
