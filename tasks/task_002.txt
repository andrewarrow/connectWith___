# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Monthly Event Cards UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core UI component of 12 visually distinct, color-coded cards (one per month) that display a single important event for each month.
# Details:
Design a card-based interface inspired by iOS Wallet passes with:
1. 12 cards in a scrollable view, one for each month
2. Unique color coding for each month
3. Card layout showing month name, event title prominently, with date and location in smaller text
4. Empty state design for months without events
5. Support for Dynamic Type and VoiceOver accessibility
6. Tap interaction to open edit interface

Implement using UICollectionView or SwiftUI equivalent with custom card views.

# Test Strategy:
Create UI tests for card rendering, scrolling behavior, and tap interactions. Test accessibility features including VoiceOver and Dynamic Type. Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards.
