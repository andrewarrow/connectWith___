# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Monthly Event Cards UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core UI component of 12 visually distinct, color-coded cards (one per month) that display a single important event for each month.
# Details:
Design a card-based interface inspired by iOS Wallet passes with:
1. 12 cards in a scrollable view, one for each month
2. Unique color coding for each month
3. Card layout showing month name, event title prominently, with date and location in smaller text
4. Empty state design for months without events
5. Support for Dynamic Type and VoiceOver accessibility
6. Tap interaction to open edit interface

Implement using UICollectionView or SwiftUI equivalent with custom card views.

# Test Strategy:
Create UI tests for card rendering, scrolling behavior, and tap interactions. Test accessibility features including VoiceOver and Dynamic Type. Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up scrollable collection view structure for monthly cards [completed]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational scrollable view that will house the 12 monthly event cards, establishing the core layout and navigation structure.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a new UICollectionViewController or SwiftUI List/ScrollView component
2. Configure the layout for horizontal scrolling with paging enabled
3. Set up the data model to represent 12 months with optional event data
4. Implement the basic collection view data source methods or SwiftUI ForEach structure
5. Add navigation controls or gestures for moving between months
6. Ensure the collection view properly handles device rotation and different screen sizes
7. Test the scrolling behavior and basic layout with placeholder card views

Testing approach:
- Verify smooth scrolling between placeholder cards
- Confirm layout adapts to different device sizes and orientations
- Validate that 12 cards are displayed in the correct order

## 2. Design and implement individual month card components with styling [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create the visual design for each monthly card, including color coding, typography hierarchy, and layout for event information display.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a custom UICollectionViewCell or SwiftUI View for the card design
2. Implement the iOS Wallet pass-inspired visual style with rounded corners and shadow effects
3. Define a color palette with 12 distinct colors for month-specific styling
4. Structure the card layout with:
   - Month name in prominent position
   - Event title with emphasized typography
   - Date and location information in smaller text
5. Create a separate design for the empty state when no event exists
6. Add visual polish with appropriate spacing, padding, and typography
7. Implement animations for card selection/focus

Testing approach:
- Review visual design on different devices to ensure consistency
- Verify color contrast meets accessibility standards
- Test with sample event data to ensure text fits appropriately
- Validate empty state design appears correctly

## 3. Implement card interactions and accessibility features [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Add tap gesture handling for card editing, implement Dynamic Type support, and ensure VoiceOver compatibility for the entire monthly cards interface.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Implement tap gesture recognizer or button action to trigger the edit interface
2. Create a simple transition animation when a card is selected
3. Add haptic feedback for card selection
4. Implement Dynamic Type support:
   - Use system fonts or scalable custom fonts
   - Test with all accessibility text sizes
   - Ensure layout adapts to larger text sizes
5. Add VoiceOver accessibility:
   - Provide meaningful accessibility labels for each card
   - Include appropriate traits (e.g., button)
   - Add accessibility hints for available actions
   - Test navigation between cards with VoiceOver
6. Implement proper semantic context for screen readers

Testing approach:
- Test tap interactions open the correct edit interface
- Verify Dynamic Type works at all size settings
- Conduct VoiceOver testing to ensure all elements are properly announced
- Validate that users can navigate and interact with cards using assistive technologies
