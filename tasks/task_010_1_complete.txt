# Task 10.1: Implement Debug View Core Interface and Bluetooth Logging [completed]

Implemented the Debug View Core Interface and Bluetooth Logging functionality with the following features:

1. Created a comprehensive `BluetoothDebugView` with multiple collapsible sections
2. Implemented real-time log display with filtering by log level (Info, Warning, Error, Debug)
3. Added detailed connection status monitoring with Bluetooth state visualization
4. Created battery usage statistics with battery impact estimates
5. Implemented error logging with detailed tracking and pattern analysis
6. Added export functionality for logs with sharing capabilities
7. Created hidden access mechanism with 5-tap gesture on main menu (works in both debug and release builds)
8. Implemented detailed device statistics including RSSI signal strength indicators
9. Added support for viewing detailed sync history and sync metrics
10. Created comprehensive data transfer monitoring with success rates

The debug view is accessible through:
1. A visible debug button in DEBUG builds
2. A hidden gesture (5 quick taps on the title area) in all builds

This satisfies all requirements for the Debug View Core Interface and provides a foundation for the remaining tasks in the diagnostics view implementation.
