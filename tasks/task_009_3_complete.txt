# Task ID: 9.3
# Title: Implement Change Highlighting and Detail View
# Status: complete
# Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Created the detailed view of individual edit history items with visual highlighting of changes and implemented conflict resolution display.

## Completed Work:
1. Created a new `HistoryDetailView.swift` file with the following features:
   - Comprehensive view showing all details of a specific edit history item
   - Before/after visual comparison for changed fields (title, location, date)
   - Clear highlighting of what changed between versions
   - Special visual treatment for conflict resolutions
   - Navigation system to view event edit history sequentially
   - Technical metadata section for advanced users
   
2. Updated the `HistoryListView` to integrate with the new detail view:
   - Added navigation links to the detail view from history items
   - Preserved the existing quick-view functionality
   - Ensured smooth transition between list and detail views

3. Implemented visual design elements:
   - Color-coded changes to make them easy to identify
   - Intuitive "before and after" comparison layout
   - Iconography to highlight different types of changes
   - Special visual treatments for conflict resolution cases

The History feature is now fully implemented and provides a clear, user-friendly way for family members to track changes to events over time, supporting the collaborative editing requirements specified in the PRD.

## Testing Notes:
- Tested the detail view with various edit scenarios including title, location, and date changes
- Verified the navigation flow between history list and detail view
- Confirmed the visual design effectively communicates changes
- Ensured accessibility features work correctly
