# Task 7.1 - Complete
Task 7.1 (Bluetooth Connection Manager) has been successfully implemented. The implementation includes:

1. Secure connection establishment with device discovery and verification
2. Application-layer security with challenge-response mechanism
3. Data exchange protocol with chunking for efficient transfer
4. Connection state management and timeout handling
5. Graceful disconnection handling
6. Transfer status tracking and logging
7. Integration with SyncHistoryManager for tracking sync statistics

The implementation provides a foundation for the full data synchronization system to be built upon in subsequent tasks.
