# Task 10.2: Implement Statistics and Metrics Visualization [completed]

Implemented comprehensive Statistics and Metrics Visualization functionality for the Bluetooth Debug View with the following features:

1. Enhanced Data Transfer Metrics:
   - Visual representation of transfer success/failure rates with color-coded indicators
   - Bar chart visualization of data exchange statistics
   - Timeline visualization of recent transfer history
   - Data size formatting with appropriate units (B, KB, MB)
   - Active transfers visualization with progress indicators

2. Enhanced Sync History Visualization:
   - Comprehensive sync summary cards with visual indicators
   - Data exchange visualizations for events sent/received
   - Sync health metrics dashboard with color-coded gauges and charts
   - Success rate and device coverage progress bars
   - Conflict resolution statistics with visual indicators
   - Expandable sync history logs with status indicators
   - Timeline-based visualization of sync activity

3. Enhanced Battery Statistics Visualization:
   - Circular gauge for battery level visualization
   - Visual indicators for battery state and charging status
   - Bluetooth impact factors visualization
   - Scan profile visualization with profile comparison
   - Duty cycle gauge with visual explanation
   - Battery drain rate visualization with color-coded indicators
   - Connected peripherals impact visualization
   - Recommendation card with visual indicators
   - Interactive scan profile selector for battery optimization

The enhanced Statistics and Metrics Visualization provides technical users with intuitive, detailed insights into the app's Bluetooth operations, making it easier to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and optimize battery usage. All visualizations are responsive and update dynamically when data changes.

This satisfies all requirements for Task 10.2 (Implement Statistics and Metrics Visualization) with comprehensive visual components that enhance the technical debugging experience.
