# Task ID: 8.1
# Title: Implement Core Sync Engine with Timestamp-based Conflict Detection
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: None

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the conflict resolution and sync engine with the following key components:

1. **ConflictResolutionEngine**: 
   - Implements a three-way merge algorithm that compares base, local, and remote versions
   - Uses timestamp-based conflict detection to identify when the same data was modified
   - Preserves all family members' edits during merge resolution
   - Applies field-specific resolution strategies based on data types

2. **SyncEngine Integration**:
   - Enhanced the SyncEngine to detect conflicts during data processing
   - Uses timestamps to identify changes since last sync
   - Applies ConflictResolutionEngine to resolve conflicts automatically
   - Records detailed conflict resolution history

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
   - Text fields: Preserves both values with attribution
   - Numeric fields: Uses latest or largest values based on context
   - Date fields: Uses timestamp-based resolution
   - Comprehensive logging of all conflict resolutions

4. **SyncHistoryManager Enhancements**:
   - Improved sync log creation with detailed conflict information
   - Added ability to update logs with resolution details

## Technical Details
- Implemented three-way merge by comparing base (common ancestor), local, and remote versions
- Added field-specific conflict resolution policies with customizable merge strategies
- Created detailed logging of all conflicts and their resolutions
- Preserved edit history for all conflict resolutions for full audit trail

## Tests Performed
- Verified conflict detection with concurrent edits of the same fields
- Confirmed conflict resolution preserves all user data
- Tested with various data types (text, numbers, dates)
- Validated proper history recording of conflict resolution

## Next Steps
The implementation is ready for further integration with edit history merging and additional conflict resolution policies for different entity types beyond events.
