# Task ID: 8.2
# Title: Develop Conflict Resolution Policies and Prioritization Rules
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 8.1

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented advanced conflict resolution policies and prioritization rules with the following key components:

1. **Enhanced ConflictResolutionEngine**:
   - Added field importance levels for prioritizing conflict resolution
   - Implemented resolution preferences with context-aware strategies
   - Created configurable resolution preferences at global and field-specific levels
   - Developed smart text merging with intelligent concatenation

2. **Detailed Conflict Detection**:
   - Added a severity assessment system for conflicts
   - Implemented field-level conflict detection and reporting
   - Added detailed conflict information with specific field conflicts
   - Created prioritization based on field importance

3. **Resolution Policy Management**:
   - Implemented multiple resolution configurations (default, conservative, simplified)
   - Added configuration management for flexibility
   - Ensured preservation of critical data during resolution
   - Created field-specific overrides for special cases

4. **Enhanced Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
   - Improved text field merging with smart concatenation
   - Added support for comma-separated values in fields
   - Implemented intelligent substring detection for text fields
   - Created logical operations for boolean and numeric fields

5. **SyncEngine Integration**:
   - Enhanced the sync process with detailed conflict reporting
   - Added resolution summaries for better logging
   - Implemented reflection-based access to field policies
   - Added severity-based logging for better diagnostics

## Technical Details
- Field importance levels (critical, high, medium, low) determine resolution priorities
- Resolution preferences (preferLocal, preferRemote, mergeAll, latest, manual) control resolution behavior
- Smart text merging detects and handles common cases like one value containing another
- Comma-separated values are treated as sets and merged with duplicates removed
- Conflict severity assessment provides better insight into conflict impact

## Tests Performed
- Tested with conflicts of varying severity across different field types
- Verified preservation of critical field data during conflicts
- Confirmed proper merging of text fields with different content
- Validated correct prioritization based on field importance
- Tested different configuration options and their effects on resolution

## Next Steps
Ready for integration with chronological history merging and syncing activity logging (task 8.3).
