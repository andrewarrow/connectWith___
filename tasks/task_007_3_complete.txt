# Task 7.3: Implement Sync Engine with Error Handling and Logging - Complete

I've successfully implemented the SyncEngine class that orchestrates data synchronization between devices, with comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and detailed logging. The implementation includes:

1. **Incremental sync logic** that efficiently transfers only changed data since the last sync
2. **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed error types and meaningful error messages
3. **Retry mechanism with exponential backoff** for recoverable failures
4. **Detailed sync logging** with metrics for events sent/received, conflicts, and duration
5. **Integration with existing components**:
   - ConnectionManager for Bluetooth connectivity
   - DataExchangeProtocol for data serialization/deserialization
   - SyncHistoryManager for tracking sync statistics
   - Core Data repositories for data operations

The SyncEngine provides a clean public API for:
- Initiating sync operations (incremental or full)
- Tracking sync progress in real-time
- Canceling ongoing sync operations
- Retrieving sync history and statistics

The implementation follows proper Swift coding conventions with clear documentation and comprehensive error handling, making it robust against connection failures, data transfer issues, and processing errors.

This completes the final component of Task 7, providing a reliable data synchronization system for the family calendar app.
