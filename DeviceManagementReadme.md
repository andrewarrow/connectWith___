# Device Management Implementation

This document provides an overview of the device management implementation for the 12x Family Event Scheduler.

## Key Components

### 1. UI Components
- **NearbyDevicesView**: Main list view showing discovered devices
- **DeviceRow**: Individual device entry in the list
- **DeviceDetailView**: Detailed view of a selected device with management options
- **RenameDeviceSheet**: Interface for renaming devices

### 2. Manager Classes
- **ConnectionManager**: Handles device connectivity and status tracking
- **SyncHistoryManager**: Tracks and manages device synchronization history
- **BluetoothDiscoveryManager**: Discovers nearby devices

### 3. Data Models
- **BluetoothDevice**: Represents a discovered Bluetooth device
- **FamilyDevice**: Represents a family member's device with custom naming

## Features

### Device Discovery
- Background scanning for nearby devices
- Display of discovered devices in a list
- Pull-to-refresh to manually scan for devices
- Visual indicators during scanning

### Device Naming
- Rename devices with family member names
- Validation to prevent empty names
- Persistence of custom names across app restarts
- Automatic use of custom names in the UI

### Connection Status
- Real-time connection status indicators
- Visual color coding (green for connected, orange for recently active)
- Last seen timestamp with relative time formatting
- Signal strength visualization

### Device Management
- Connect/disconnect functionality with progress indicators
- Sync calendar data between devices
- Remove devices with confirmation dialog
- Detailed device information display

### Sync History
- Track and display last sync time
- Show statistics for events sent and received
- Record conflicts and their resolution
- Maintain a history of sync operations

## Usage

1. **Discovering Devices**:
   - Navigate to the "Family Devices" screen
   - Pull down to refresh or tap the refresh button to scan for devices
   - Newly discovered devices will appear in the list

2. **Viewing Device Details**:
   - Tap on a device in the list to view its details
   - The detail view shows connection status, identity information, and sync history

3. **Renaming Devices**:
   - Long-press on a device and select "Rename" or
   - Tap "Edit" in the device details view
   - Enter a new name and tap "Save"

4. **Connecting to Devices**:
   - Tap "Connect Now" in the device details view
   - Connection status will update in real-time
   - Once connected, the status indicator will turn green

5. **Syncing with Devices**:
   - When connected to a device, tap "Sync Calendar Data"
   - Sync progress is shown during the operation
   - Sync history will update after completion

6. **Removing Devices**:
   - Tap "Remove Device" in the device details view
   - Confirm the deletion in the confirmation dialog
   - The device will be removed from your list

## Technical Notes

- Device discovery uses Core Bluetooth framework
- Device information is persisted using Core Data
- Connection management uses the Combine framework for async operations
- All operations are logged for debugging purposes
- Battery-optimized scanning is implemented to conserve power
