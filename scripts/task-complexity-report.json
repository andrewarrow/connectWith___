      "taskTitle": "Build Event Creation and Editing Interface",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Event Creation and Editing Interface into subtasks covering modal presentation, form design, validation logic, preview functionality, Core Data integration, and edit history tracking",
      "reasoning": "This task combines UI design with data persistence logic. It requires form validation, preview functionality, Core Data integration, and edit history tracking. The combination of UI and business logic increases complexity."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Bluetooth Connection and Data Exchange",
      "complexityScore": 10,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Bluetooth Connection and Data Exchange implementation into subtasks covering connection establishment, protocol design, data serialization, incremental sync logic, error handling, logging, and security implementation",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task, involving secure Bluetooth connections, custom protocol design, data serialization, incremental syncing, and robust error handling. The combination of networking, security, and data management makes this extremely challenging."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Build Conflict Resolution and Sync Engine",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Conflict Resolution and Sync Engine into subtasks covering merge algorithm implementation, conflict detection logic, edit preservation policies, history merging, resolution rules, and sync activity logging",
      "reasoning": "Implementing conflict resolution algorithms is highly complex, requiring sophisticated logic to handle concurrent edits. This task involves designing and implementing a robust system that can handle various edge cases while preserving user data."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement History Log and Visualization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the History Log and Visualization implementation into subtasks covering chronological display design, edit attribution, change highlighting, filtering functionality, and Core Data integration",
      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a UI to visualize edit history with filtering options. While primarily UI-focused, it requires thoughtful design to make complex edit histories understandable to users, with moderate data manipulation complexity."
